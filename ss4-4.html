        A <strong>website</strong> (also written as a <strong>web site</strong> ) is one or more <a href="#">web pages</a> and related content that is identified by a common <a href="#">domain name</a> and published on at least one <a href="#">web server</a>. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <a href="#">social media.</a> <a href="#">Hyperlinking</a> between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a <a href="#">home page</a>. The <a href="#">most-visited</a> sites are <a href="#">Google</a>, <a href="#">YouTube</a>, and <a href="#">Facebook</a>.
       <p>
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <a href="#">World Wide Web</a>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <a href="#">private network</a>, such as a company's internal website for its employees. <a href="#">Users</a> can access websites on a range of devices, including <a href="#">desktops</a>, <a href="#">laptops</a>, <a href="#">tablets</a>, and <a href="#">smartphones</a>. The <a href="#">app</a> used on these devices is called a <a href="#">web browser</a>.
